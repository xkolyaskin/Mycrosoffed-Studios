# Mycrosoffed-Studios: 2025 C3 Game Jam 

## About
Our game, Khailino, tells the story of Akket, a newcomer to a remote village in the Russian Far East, where climate change is rapidly reshaping traditional ways of life. Guided by the village elder, Otap, players experience the challenges of herding reindeer, fishing, and farming as the environment changes around them. 

## Our Goal
Our goal was to highlight the resilience of Indigenous communities while raising awareness of the real-world impacts of climate change based on research. 

## C3 Game Jam
We won overall best game and $1000 after taking on the C3 48-hour Spring Break Game Jam at Purdue University.
